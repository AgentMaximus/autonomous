# Autonomous Project

---

## Overview

The `autonomous` project provides a solution related to autonomous systems management, with particular focus on efficiency, reliability, and scalability in the context of data processing and deployment.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgentMaximus/autonomous.git
   cd autonomous
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

## Usage

To execute the main script, navigate to the directory with the scripts and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or to start the FastAPI server for the web interface:

```bash
uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload
```

This will start a web server for the autonomous management tool, enabling users to handle tasks effectively via a web-based interface.
